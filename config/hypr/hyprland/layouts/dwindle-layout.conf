# Dwindle Layout Configuration
# https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Dwindle-Layout/
#
# Dwindle is a BSPWM-like layout where every window on a workspace
# is a member of a binary tree. Splits are determined dynamically
# by the W/H ratio of the parent node (W > H = side-by-side, H > W = top-bottom).

    pseudotile = false
    
    # Split direction behavior:
    # 0 = split follows mouse position
    # 1 = always split to the left (new window = left or top)
    # 2 = always split to the right (new window = right or bottom)
    force_split = 0
    
    # If enabled, the split (side/top) will not change regardless of container changes
    # This makes splits PERMANENT instead of dynamic
    preserve_split = false
    
    # If enabled, allows precise split control based on cursor position
    # The window is divided into four triangles, cursor's triangle determines split direction
    # This also turns on preserve_split automatically
    smart_split = false
    
    # If enabled, resizing direction is based on mouse position on the window (nearest corner)
    # Otherwise, it's based on the window's tiling position
    smart_resizing = true
    
    # If enabled, makes the preselect direction persist until:
    # - This mode is turned off
    # - Another direction is specified
    # - A non-direction is specified (anything other than l,r,u/t,d/b)
    permanent_direction_override = false
    
    # Scale factor for windows on the special workspace [0.0 - 1.0]
    # 1.0 = full size, 0.5 = half size, etc.

    # Higher values = more vertical splits on wide monitors

    # true = use active window, false = use mouse position
    use_active_for_splits = true
    
    # Default split ratio on window open [0.1 - 1.9]
    # 1.0 = even 50/50 split

    default_split_ratio = 1.0

    # bindm movewindow will drop the window more precisely based on mouse position
    # More accurate window placement when dragging
    precise_mouse_move = false
    
    # When only a single window is shown, add padding to conform to aspect ratio
    # Format: width height (e.g., "4 3" makes a 4:3 window on 16:9 screen)
    # "0 0" = disabled (no padding)
    single_window_aspect_ratio = 0 0
    
    # Tolerance for single_window_aspect_ratio [0.0 - 1.0]
    # If padding would be smaller than this fraction of screen height/width, don't adjust
